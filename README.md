# BlazorInAngularDemo

> ### A demo project for integrating Blazor components into an existing Angular app.

&nbsp;

## Motivation

Although Blazor is a great choice for creating web frontends, abolishing an existing Angular app and starting from scratch is often no option. This project demonstrates, how .NET 7+ Blazor components can be integrated in an existing Angular project, making it possible to migrate step by step.

## Implementation details

Here are the basic steps how we implemented the demo based on the original Angular project:

* [[Commit]](https://github.com/Xenoage/BlazorInAngularDemo/commit/3ae2ab6ea282bed4a849ec48baeae355b247ba23) We cloned the __[Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/guide/example-apps-list#tour-of-heroes-completed-application)__ demo application from the angular.io docs into the `Angular` directory. We compiled and ran the Angular app to make sure everything was working so far: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` and `npm start`.
* ... Work in progress.
